At the same time learn how to properly scale and response our pages in different device and width, whilst some good understanding of how to linking to different parts of the page.

# My Version

I decided to somewhat go my own way, as we were told it was okay and I approached this in a much more minimalistic but stylish way:

For this project I turned the header into a static video and the static project or work section as a animated scrolling video.


## Issues With This Project

* I spent 6-8 hours of just working the header. Restructuring the video background and changing it to suit a sort of taste I can like. Even compiling free stock videos
